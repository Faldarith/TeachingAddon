# TeachingAddon
This addon is used to teach how to write addons. It is a blank canvas, so to speak.

Leave the Main branch pure, make changes in a new branch.

## Note

This addon is built on-top of the Ace3 framework. The "Libs" folder contains Ace3 and all of its modules.

## Environment
We (strongly) recommend you use IntelliJ IDEA for your IDE alongside the EmmyLua plugin.

In-game we recommend using BugGrabber and BugSack for catching Lua errors, and DevTool is a great addon for inspecting Lua tables in real-time.
